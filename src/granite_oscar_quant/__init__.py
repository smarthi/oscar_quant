"""Public package API for the IBM Granite OScaR adapter.

The package root exposes the lightweight Pydantic models immediately and lazily
loads the torch-heavy patching functions only when callers ask for them. That
keeps configuration and schema imports cheap in tools, tests, and notebooks that
do not need to instantiate a model.

    What it does:
        Resolves torch-backed patch helpers and the high-level patched-model
        loader only when those names are requested.

    Why it exists:
        Importing the patch module imports torch and later touches Hugging Face
        model symbols. Delaying that work keeps simple config/schema imports
        fast and avoids surprising import failures in environments that are only
        inspecting metadata.

    How it helps:
        Downstream code can use `from granite_oscar_quant import OscarKVConfig`
        without paying the model-runtime import cost, while still getting
        convenient package-root imports for the patched-model entry points.
